# My personal webpage
#### https://sxubas.github.io/

Personal webpage project for (fall 2018) web development class @ Uniandes.
The main objective with this page is to expose my interests and projects with other people. It may also serve as an extended presentation card.

Is is made completely using HTML5, CSS2 and vainilla JS. Everything is 'merged' into the "index.html" file to easen development.

In order to run it, first clone the repository. Then, you may host a local server on the folder (make sure it takes "index.html" as the default html to return) and access it through a web browser. It can also be opened directly from the "index.html" file but media files may not be served.
